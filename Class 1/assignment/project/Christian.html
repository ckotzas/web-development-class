			<p>I am an architect, working at a large internationally recognized architecture firm located in downtown Manhattan. My role within the firm is <em class="designer">Designer</em>, it should be obvious to everyone reading this that <strong class="designer">Designers</strong> are the cool guys because we get to make things look good while other people have to figure out the boring stuff. Now that I have given you all an idea of how cool I am I will go on to show you some of the beautiful stuf I have designed:</p>

			<img src="architecture-3.jpg" alt="jpg"><aside>And Pointy Stuff</aside>
		<h3 class="third-heading">Other Passtimes</h3>
			<p>For physical excercise and when I am not at work designing buildings I like to get myself out there and experience the good things life has to offer. These activities I hold sacred and without them I would be at a loss:</p>

				<img src="sex.jpg" alt="jpg"><aside>I engage in sexual acts</aside>
		<h4 class="fourth-heading">Travel</h4>
